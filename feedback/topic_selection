My main ideas for this project were: 
1. Analyze the growth of hockey in the United States through NHL attendance.
2. Analyze Houston Astros data between the 2017 and 2023 
3. What are the most popular shows on Netflix?

I got feedback from Justin Ross, Bryce Marshall, and Nate Lewis. The consensus was that any of these ideas would make worthwhile projects since I love sports and Netflix. They also agreed that each idea would allow for opportunites to clean, analyze, and present the data.

I chose to continue with the Houston Astros idea. I will be scraping schedule results from Baseball Reference between 2017 and 2023 and look for interesting insights. My peers also agreed that this project would be insightful for fellow baseball lovers like myself.
