⁃ For your data collection post, you’ve got a good walkthrough of your webscraping function and your loop to clean the data. I would suggest maybe bolding the official steps just so they stand out a little more from the bullet points and code. (Ie. ‘Define Function’, ‘Get HTML Content’). I think that would improve the readability of the post, but everything looks great overall!

- This is kind of a nitpick but I noticed some bullet points end with periods and others end without punctuation, so maybe make that more consistent.

- This looks really good. I think you do a good job of emphasizing the most important parts of webscraping. Make sure to include something in your post that shows consideration for the ethics of webscraping. You could make reference to the robots.txt file, for example.

I made sure to back through my data collection blog post and remove periods after the bullet points so that it was consistent throughout. I also went through and bolded the headers so that they stuck out a little more. These changes helped the overall look of my blog post and improved readibility. I also added a portion to my post referring to the robots.txt to show consideration for the ethics of webscraping.
